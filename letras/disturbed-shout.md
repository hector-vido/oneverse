Shout

Disturbed (Tears for Fears)
---------------------------

```
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm a-talking to you, so, come on

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on (come get it on, come get it on)
I'm a-talking to you
So, come on (come get it on, come get it on)

In violent times
You shouldn't have to sell your soul
In black and white
They really, really ought to know (they just don't know)
Those one-track minds
Who took you for a working whore
Kiss them goodbye
You shouldn't have to jump for joy (jump, jump, jump, jump)
You shouldn't have to shout for joy

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on (come get it on, come get it on)
I'm a-talking to you, so, come on (come get it on, come get it on)

They gave you life
And in return, you gave 'em hell
As cold as ice (now, bitch, you're ice, ice, baby)
I hope we live to tell the tale
I hope we live to shout the tale

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on (come get it on, come get it on)
I'm a-talking to you, so, come on

*Solo*

Will you never shout?
I feel it building, are you ever gonna let it all out?
Will you never shout?
I feel it building, are you ever gonna let it all out?
Will you never shout?
I feel it building, are you ever gonna let it all out?
Will you never shout?
I feel it building, are you ever gonna let it?

And when you've taken down your guard
If I could change your mind
I'd really love to break your heart (break, break, break, break, break)
I'd really love to break your heart

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on (come get it on, come get it on, come get it on, come get it on)
I'm a-talking to you, so, come on (come get it on, come get it on)
I'd really love to shout, shout (come on, le-let me shout, shout, let it all out)
Let it all out (these are the things I can do without, so come on)
These are the things I can do without (but come on, baby, I'm a-talking to you, a-come on)
(But come on, baby, let me shout, shout, let me shout)
Come on (come on, baby, let me shout, shout, let it all out)
I'm talking to you, so, come on (these are the things I can do without, so come on)
Shout, shout (but come on, baby, I'm a-talking to you, a-come on)
Shout, shout (but come on, baby, let me shout, shout, let me shout)

Shout
Shout
Come on, le-let me shout, shout, let me
Come on, le-let me shout, shout (shout)
Come on, le-let me shout, shout, let me
Come on, le-let me shout, shout (shout)
