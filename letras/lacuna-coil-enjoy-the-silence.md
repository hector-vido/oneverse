Enjoy the Silence
=================

Lacuna Coild (Depeche Mode)
---------------------------

```
Words like violence
Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world

Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Can't you understand
Oh, my little girl

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here
In my arms
Words are very
Unnecessary
They can only do harm

*Ponte*
*Suspiros*

Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here
In my arms
Words are very
Unnecessary
They can only do harm

*Ponte*

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here
In my arms
Words are very
Unnecessary
They can only do harm

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here
In my arms
Words are very
Unnecessary
They can only do harm

*Vocalização* (Enjoy the silence) x4
