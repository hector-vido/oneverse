Material Girl (Madonna)
-----------------------

```
Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit
I just walk away

They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
Is always Mister Right

*Ponte*

Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest
Then I have to let them be

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

*Ponte*

Boys may come, and boys may go
And that's all right, you see
Experience has made me rich
And now they're after me

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl (ah)

I'm material, I'm material...

Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
