The Pretender
-------------

```
Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark
And so it all began

Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones come marchin' in again
The need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are at the ready
Are you ready?

I'm finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance, that whole defense
Spinning infinity, but
The wheel is spinning me, it's never-ending, never-ending
Same old story

  | What if I say I'm not like the others?
2 | What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
x | You're the pretender
  | What if I say I will never surrender?

In time, or so I'm told
I'm just another soul for sale, oh well
The page is out of print
We are not permanent, we're temporary, temporary
Same old story

  | What if I say I'm not like the others?
2 | What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
x | You're the pretender
  | What if I say I will never surrender?

Oh oh oh...

I'm the voice inside your head you refuse to hear
I'm the face that you have to face, mirroring your stare
I'm what's left, I'm what's right, I'm the enemy
I'm the hand that'll take you down, bring you to your knees
So, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?

Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend

  | What if I say I'm not like the others?
2 | What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
x | You're the pretender
  | What if I say I will never surrender?

  | (Keep you in the dark) What if I say I'm not like the others?
2 | (You know they all) What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
x | You're the pretender (pretend)
  | What if I say I will never surrender?

Oh oh....
So, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
